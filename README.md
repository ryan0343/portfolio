This is a web portfolio based on my design produced in UX Design I.

Process Notes & Lessons: 
 = Initially had some difficulties with getting the BS hamburger menu to work. Upon reviewing the BS setup Docs, I realised I hadn't linked the JS Properly.


I had a lot of anxiety going through with this project. At the time of submission, the site is definitely incomplete, and apart from a carousel, my work really isn't featured at all whatsoever. Although I have a solid plan and have learned much about using Bootstrap and other libraries throughout this project, I definitely have a lot of room for improvement this coming break.

While implementing the  libraries wasn't a problem for me, getting SVG shapes to align themselves with the content was an issue when not utilising them as an img.

I also realized quite a few more issues with the website design as I was coding it, at least in terms of convenience to the user and usability overall. A single page scrolling website would have been far easier to both code and for navigational purposes, despite having a higher initial loading cost due to loading most content on one page.

Although I was unable to get it done in time, an aspect of the website I plan on finishing on my own time is the use of BS Color modes in order to produce a proper dark mode version of the website, so lower eyestrain can be found for uses who prefer that theme. The methods to do this can be found at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/color-modes/, which I plan to further explore on my own time.

With the features and pages I was unable to complete, I currently have set as disabled. On my own time, I plan to realize the rest of the website as a practice, and then perhaps redesign certain portions according to the lessons learned during this project. One such library that caught my eye late into this project was the Isotope layout found at https://isotope.metafizzy.co/. I believe that using this layout for my products page would be far more effective than what I already had planned out, and I would love to try and work with this library in future projects.
